<b><h1>TobuNES</h1></b>

This is a port of "Tobu Tobu Girl" for the NES.  Links to the original game can be found on <a href="https://github.com/SimonLarsen/tobutobugirl-dx">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://tangramgames.itch.io/tobu-tobu-girl-deluxe">Itch-IO</a>.<br>

All art assets are created by me, or were found on <a href="https://opengameart.org/">OpenGameArt</a> and were CC0 (aka Public Domain).<br>

To assemble the code, I am using Loopy's "asm6", found on <a href="https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/Tools">NesDev Tools</a>.  The included Combiner and Converter are what I use after the assembler to compile the ROM.  I use my own <a href="https://github.com/stevenchadburrow/PICnes">PICnes Emulator</a> for testing.<br>
